## Project Description 📋

This PWA works as a budget tracker with an Online/Offline functionality that enables the user to add or subtract from the budget while being disconnected. The assignment showcases my knowledge of PWA building and a proper webmanifest and service worker structure with the option of installation using custom icons. It works with a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/es/cloud/atlas/register) database and a [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) deployment.


## Mockup 🔧
